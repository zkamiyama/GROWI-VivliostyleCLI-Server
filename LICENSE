                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specially designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
 free software for all its users.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.

 A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 incorporate.  For example, network server programs often lack the
 source code necessary to modify them, because only the original
 developer runs them on a server and offers the program as a service
 over the network.  The Affero General Public License ensures that the
 users who interact with the program remotely through a computer
 network also have the ability to receive the source code for the
 program.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
 notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this License.  The "Program", below, refers to
 any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
 either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that
 is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
 verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
 in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
 Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
 the Program (independent of having been made by running the
 Program).

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.

 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
 to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work
 that is normally distributed alongside the major components (which
 are not part of the work), nor does it include the System Libraries
 of the Major Component.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a work based on the Program (independent of
 having been made by running the Program).

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
 conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you changed
    the files and the date of any change.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under one of the following
 options:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Accompany the object code with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or
    customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
    possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding
    Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this
    License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
    interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
    physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to
    copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This option is
    allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
    subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place ("offering a download"), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    additional charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source alongside the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as necessary to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

 7. Additional Terms.

 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 this License without regard to the additional permissions.

 Additional terms may be stated using the following "Additional terms"
 label.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be added
 to a covered work.  When additional terms are added they must be
 listed with the relevant files, and they must not contradict the
 terms of this License.
